In this project, we compared the relative expression of immune gene signatures among 59 patients with retinoblastoma and classified retinoblastoma into two subgroups according to the immune cell infiltration (ICI) scores. Hypermethylated genes in the high-ICI subgroup were associated with immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that DNA methylation may play a vital regulatory role in retinoblastoma immunity.
